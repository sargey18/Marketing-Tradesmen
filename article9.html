                        Hey, everyone, this is Joe Burnich with BigWestMarketing.com. What I want to show you today is what exactly SEO backlinks are and how they work. Let’s get started with that right now.



                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Okay, so we’re on Google here. Now, let’s just do a search. I’m just going to use my hometown, Missoula. Missoula, Montana is where I’m located here. So let’s go to the official Missoula website, see what they’ve got going on here. Okay, so I’m on just an authority website, a website that Google really likes. It’s a city website. Let’s see. Let’s go over to this article about COVID stuff here. Let’s jump on there. So you see this little mini article about COVID. Now, if you notice right here, they’ve got a link. This little word here will link over to a different website. It’s a COVID specific website. So let’s click on that. So that’s a backlink over to this website.





                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        And then let’s say we’re in here, and we go down to the food security section. I don’t even know what this stuff is. I’m just using it as an example. And they’ve got a link right here. You see how the words here, they turn to blue, and you can click on those words and it jumps you over to the Missoula Food Bank. So now we’ve got a backlink going from the COVID website in Missoula over to the Missoula Food Bank.





                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        And these are what backlinks are. They’re very simple. It’s a very simple thing. And then you see these other backlinks on this website. When the internet was created, they created all these different ways for websites to link to each other. And Google actually uses those links or backlinks, whatever you want to call them, to decide if a website is valuable to searchers or not. So what you want to do is you want to have your website looking all pretty, and having all kinds of good information, and structured the way Google likes it, all that good stuff. But then you want to have other authority websites, or other websites that Google likes, you want to have backlinks on those websites that come over to your website. That’s what’s really going to put turbo boosters on your SEO.





                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        But before we go too far, before, we’re just like, “Oh, I want to start getting lots of links,” I want to show you how this whole backlink game works. So here’s my little drawing program I’ve got set up here. Let me grab the paint brush here. So imagine that this, that we’ve got like a mountain here, and this mountain is the Google search page. And you want to climb this mountain all the way to the top, like this, and then let’s level out. That’s the top of Google. That’s the top of the mountain there. But then, picture that on the other side there, there’s just a sharp cliff, just a drop off. And so then you’re over here, you’ve got your business here, and you’re starting at the bottom, and you want to start getting to the top of Google here.





                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        So what you’re going to do is you’re going to build out your website right here. That’s your website. And so that’s going to push you a little bit higher up the Google mountain here. And then you’ve got your Google My Business page, where you get the postcard sent out and you get your Google account. You’re all set up. So Google’s going to push you a little bit higher. Now you’re starting to make some progress. And then you get all your powerful online directory set up, like you get your Yelp business set up. Then you get your Facebook business set up. Google sees those, like oh, he’s a more legit business. Then you start getting some Google reviews. You’re getting online reviews. And pretty soon, you start climbing up and you get to this point where you’re not right fully to the top, and you’ve got your foundational stuff set up. This is all the foundational stuff we’re talking about here.





                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        So now, you’ve got to right here and you just need an extra push to get to the top of Google right here. You want to get up to the top of Google, where you get all the phone calls. You start dominating your cities and the surrounding areas, and everything’s just clicking. This is where everybody wants to be in the service industry. All right, so how do we get up there? Well, that’s where the backlinks come in. When you start getting backlinks from other websites, like I showed you, pointing over to your website, that’s when you put those turbo boosters on. That’s what’s going to skyrocket you up here.





                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But, but, here’s what you’ve got to really be careful of, is let’s say you’re working with Big West Marketing and you get involved with our exclusive backlink network that we built up over the years, which I’ll explain in a minute. But what I want to show is like, let’s say that we put a backlink on there and all of a sudden, boom, it pushes you up here. Now you’re a little bit higher. Now you’ve used that backlink, and you’re a little bit higher. And we’d wait a couple months to make sure you’d get to that spot. And then we kind of see that everything settles down again, and then we throw another backlink on there. Now you’re a little bit higher.




                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And these are quality backlinks. These aren’t any backlinks. These are special, quality backlinks. Not all backlinks are the same. And then we put a third one on there after another two months. And boom, now you’re at the top. Now you’ve made it. That’s how it works. And so over those two, four, six months of adding those backlinks very carefully and seeing what happens, we’re able to get you to the top. That’s how it’s done. That’s why it takes so long. That’s why this is a long game. This is not a quick fix.




                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But let’s talk about that quick fix. Let’s say that you’re working with an SEO company, or let’s say you decide to just go buy some backlinks yourself, because you can get on these websites out there and you can buy a pack of 50 backlinks a month or 100 backlinks. And they’re cheap. It’s like a couple hundred bucks maybe to get all these backlinks. That’s what you want. But the problem is, when you buy those backlinks they come from what are called backlink farms. And they’re made on cheesy websites. Most of them are in China or India. If you start getting Chinese and Indian links coming to your website, Google is going to look at that and be like, this doesn’t make sense.

                        And sometimes you put those backlinks on there and they can actually boost you up for like a week or two, or even a month, but then once Google figures out what’s going on and they review your situation and your site and all that stuff, then all of a sudden it pushes you off the edge. So now you put these turbo boosters on your website, but boom, now you go too far, and now you drop, you drop all the way down here. And guess what? You’ve got to start all the way over. Spend another six months, spend another year proving to yourself, to Google, telling Google that you want to take these backlinks off. And it’s just this game that these companies out there, these shady companies out there, have created to sell backlinks, because they know you’ve heard about backlinks and you know that they’re part of SEO and they’re a way to get you to the top of Google, but you just don’t know how the game works. So they’re selling you junk. They’re selling you junk that’s going to hurt you in the longterm. If you want to do it right, you do very few high quality backlinks, and you do them slowly over time, and that’s going to get you to the top of the mountain.

                        Now, real quick. What I want to do is show you, let me get my little handy eraser tool here so I can show you what the backlink network is that we’ve created. I want to show you how that works. Let’s see, where’s the eraser? All right, let me make it bigger here. All right, let me erase all this. So imagine that this is your business right here. This is you, businessman, just kicking ass and taking names, making lots of money, getting lots of clients. You’re doing SEO right. You’re doing good work. You’re asking for referrals. You’re asking for reviews, all that stuff. This is you right here.

                        And your website, this is you and your website, and you want to take it to the next level and you want to start getting links, because you’re working with Big West Marketing. Well, how does this link program work? Well, over the years we went out and we created all these websites. And we make sure we buy these websites that are already in existence, and we make sure we use all these tools and these fancy methods to figure out which ones we like the best, which ones are for sale, old businesses or websites that have gone out of business, and they have a lot of trust and authority with Google. Google loves all these websites, and we’re building these out over the years and we’re spending hundreds, sometimes a thousand, $1,500 to buy these websites.


                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And then what we do is we create articles on these websites. And then, like I showed you before, we create links within the text there and these links point back to you. This is how this works. And so these are not junk links. These are links that we carefully built, and we own this network, so we have full control. We’re not buying these links from some company that may go out of business or may decide to do something scammy in the future. But what we’re doing is we’re building these websites out, and it’s growing every year. Every year we get another 10 to 20, sometimes 30 websites in here for our clients, specifically for our clients. And these links over time, if built correctly and built slowly, point back to you, Google notices, and then like I showed you in the last illustration, that you start climbing that mountain till you get to the top.


                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And then we leave these links as is for as long as you work with us. So that’s how Big West works. We have this exclusive network. I don’t know any other competitor in my space that works with our service industries that does it this way. They go out and they buy stuff. They go out and buy. They don’t want to take the time, put in the headache and the money to build this network out. What they want to do is just go out and find someone who does it for them, and then they pay them money, and then they hope, they hope, that that company doesn’t do any shady practices, and they hope that that company doesn’t go out of business. And it’s not well monitored. It’s just kind of like put some money out there and hope that it works. That’s how most companies do it, unfortunately.

                        Luckily for us, that we’re in a specific industry and we can build out relevant websites that can link back to you, create backlinks, and get your website up to Google, and then stay up there in the longterm.


                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So I hope this was a good explanation. I hope it wasn’t too wordy and too long winded, but I hope this gives you a good idea of how SEO backlinks work as a whole, and then if you decide to work with Big West marketing, how we do this for you.
