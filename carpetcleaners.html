                <h2>Why Is Digital Advertising Important For Carpet Cleaning Businesses?</h2>
                <div class="text-section-content">
                    <p>
                        Aside from doing excellent work, promoting your services to get calls, texts, and emails must be one of your top priorities as an Carpet cleaning business owner.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Digital marketing makes sure you're in front of the customers who need you most, and that means more calls, clicks, and jobs for you and your employees.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        However, if it's done right, marketing also protects you from your lower-quality competitors because they probably won't be doing this!
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        Traditional marketing approaches like radio and fliers can do a lot for you.
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        Social media might help you a bit too.
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        But these methods share something in common that hurts their effectiveness: theyâ€™re targeting everyday consumers and hoping they have a job for you.
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        Even if they do, people aren't likely to give you a call on their way to work after seeing your billboard or hearing your ad.
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        Why?
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        Because they have a lot of things on their mind.
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        They're even less likely to call while watching cat videos on facebook because they're trying to unwind, not think about scheduling an carpet cleaning inspection.
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        It's best to leave these types of marketing to your competitors because, though they might not get calls or jobs from those marketing channels, they can still serve as reminders that make people think "damn, I still need to find someone to do that job for me."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That's where you come in.

                    <p>
                        We specialize in a subset of SEO called Local Search Engine Optimization, or Local SEO for short.
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        The more Google likes your website, the higher it will appear in the list of search results, and the easier it will be for people to find you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Basically, you want to do everything you can to be Google's local favorite, which would earn you a spot in the maps section at the top of the page.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is where most people click first, so it's where you need to be.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re not there right away. The results in the 3-pack--or Map Pack, as itâ€™s also called--largely depend on where your business is in relation to the searcherâ€™s location.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Still, there are actions you can take to influence the Maps rankings. Which leads us to...
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        Getting More Google Reviews
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        It's true that a large number of reviews improves your prospects in the SEO ranking game.
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        However, they are more than just an accessory to propel your website to the top of the page. In fact, they are a necessity because they're the new word of mouth and the way you can earn your potential clients' trust.
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        People aren't going to trust your carpet cleaning business just because you have a high-ranking website with good content and pictures. They want to hear from people like them who have seen the work you did and were impressed by it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This may seem like something that is just out of your control.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It's up to the customer to write a review, right? All I can do is do great work and hope it amazes the customer enough for them to go online and give me great feedback unprompted, right?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Wrong!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you want good reviews, you have to make it so easy that the customers could practically do it in their sleep, and that's all up to you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That means putting the direct link to your "Write a review" page in a prominent place on your website and in emails and texts to customers directly after youâ€™ve completed a job for them. There's no reward for people leaving feedback, so you want to make it easy for them. You want it to be a matter of them looking at their phone, clicking a link, typing your praises, and posting it so that they can get on with their lives.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        Mobile-First Website

                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        As we said before, most people are going to be looking for your services on their phone.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Mobile device users are going to make up 80 to 90 percent of your audience, so you shouldn't be building your website only for the tiny slice of people using a computer. Your site can't just be mobile friendly anymore, and it can't just look nice on the smaller screen. It needs to work well too.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That means lots of buttons: tap to call, tap to text, and tap to schedule. It also means that it has to load quickly, and have a big, prominent number on every page.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These are principles of marketing that are guaranteed to work because they convert mere website visits into action, calls, and jobs.
                    </p>

                        You now understand the importance of Google-centric digital marketing and why you should just leave some types of advertising to your competitors.
