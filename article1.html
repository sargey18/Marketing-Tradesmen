                        Hey guys, I’m Joe Burnich with BigWestMarketing.com. In this short video, I want to talk about how you can build massive trust with Google using the Google guarantee. Let’s get started right now.


                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Okay, so what is the Google guarantee? Let’s jump over to Google real quick. I’m going to show you. So if we just do a quick search for plumbers in Los Angeles, let’s say. You’re going to see these ads at the top. And they’re going to have this little check mark that says, “Google guarantee.” So these are paid ads. I’m not telling you that you need to run paid ads. That’s not what this video is about. It’s about building trust with Google. Now how do you get in here? A lot of cities don’t offer it. Like let’s try, last I checked, they do not offer it in my town of Missoula, Montana. Let’s check. Yeah, see they don’t even offer it here in Missoula, Montana. So it’s not offered everywhere, but you can still go through the process of getting the Google guarantee and you don’t have to spend any money, you do not have to run ads, and it doesn’t even have to be offered in your area.


                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        So why would you do it then? Well, the number one reason is because you want to get on Google’s good list. You don’t want to be on Google’s bad list. You want to make sure that Google loves your business and knows that you are legit. You want to do this for SEO reasons because you can rank down here. And this little map pack here, this is where you’re going to get the most business and where you’re going to get the highest quality clients. This is where they can actually read your reviews and stuff like that. And this is where most people put most of their trust is right here. Getting that Google guarantee, there is some sort of connection, we don’t know exactly what it is yet. Nobody really does yet, but there’s some sort of connection with getting that Google guarantee and ranking in this map pack and also avoiding any kind of Google penalties.


                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        Because what’s going on right now is Google is battling all kinds of fake listings, spam or you probably have seen like competitors that just create phony little listings because they want to rank in different cities and stuff like that. This is a step towards preventing that and making sure you don’t get filtered in and put into that category. It happens all the time. Good legitimate businesses get put in the spam category because Google doesn’t know any better. It’s just software going out there and making decisions, not human beings. So what we need to do is protect ourselves and we can do this by getting the Google guarantee.


                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        Now all you do to do this and it’s free, is let’s just go to Google and we’ll type in Google guarantee. All right. Now the first thing that pops up is local services by Google. That’s what you want. So this is only for service based businesses, by the way. I can’t, even though I do provide a service, it’s for home service businesses, which is who we do work for. So let’s look at it real quick. Let’s click on get started. And this is all you’re going to do. You’re going to start going through their vetting process. So they’re going to ask about insurance and local licenses and stuff like that. So you’ve got to have all your ducks in a row before you do this. Like I said, Google wants legit businesses and this is how you’re going to prove to Google that you are legit, even though your spammy competitor is not.


                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        So, fill all this out. Let’s look at the different job categories. This is the different industries. So we’ve got appliance repair, carpet cleaner, electrician, house cleaner, HVAC, lawn care, even pet groomer, plumbers obviously, roofers, water damage, window cleaners. These are all people that can get in there and they even have photographers. And I think they’re going to be expanding these job categories. So if you don’t fit into this right now, then you probably will be able to do this in the future. But if you do fit into one of these categories, one of these industries, get this done ASAP. Get the process started. It can be kind of a pain, but that puts you in a better position than your competitors if they don’t do this. And like I said, it’s free. You don’t have to run the ads. You don’t have to do any of that stuff. Just get the Google guarantee so that you can rank in the map pack. It’s for SEO reasons as well.


                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        And that’s it. That’s all I have. Now, Big West Marketing is not able to do this for you. We’re not able to go through the vetting process for you. I wish we could. I wish we could offer this as a service. Google does not allow it. All right? So please don’t call up and ask us to do this for you. I would love to, but we just cannot do it. This is just a video for your information because I want you guys, the legit people, to get out there and put yourself in a safe place so you don’t get penalized and you don’t get put into that spam box. And that’s it. So if you do have any questions, if you would like to talk about internet marketing in general and getting ranked up in Google, SEO and high converting web design, if you want to talk about that kind of stuff, give us a call at (406) 493-1881 or visit bigwestmarketing.com. Once again, I’m Joe Burnich and I’ll talk to you soon.
