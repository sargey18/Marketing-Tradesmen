## New/Potential User Goals
As a new user, I want to easily navigate through the website to find the relevant content for my specific needs, effortlessly.

- The navigation bar is clearly defined and easily navigable for users to find and use.
- The drop down in the navigation menu easily allows the user to identify relevant content for themselves (their specific niche).
- The blog page has a start here section allowing the users to get a background education before going into more specific tips.
- The logo image on the top left of each page leads users back to the home page.
- The footer menu is easy to use with appropriate icons for easy identification.

- The 'About' page is appropriately named for identifying customers common frustrations with working online and offers suitable solutions. 
- Each articles has a related reading section which offers related content to the article.
- The consultation is easy to find on the top of the navbar and is promoted as a way to gain feedback about plans to promote a business online. 

- The social links are located in the footer on desktop and tablet devices.
- In each instance, each link is represented by an appropriate icon for easy identification of the social platform.

# User testing 

Several tradesmen were asked to view the site and give feedback, it was through this feedback that I settled on the current header design with the three drop downs as a way to direct users who have little to know experience with working online to the relevant materials. 

Before this there were more elements in the header but this lead to confusion because many of them had never heard of topics like seo, or had little idea about online marketing.
