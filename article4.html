                        You may wonder why I didn’t start with this chapter. Shouldn’t we first focus on the way the website looks before we start talking about conversions? The answer is “NO.” As a web designer, you would think that pictures, layout, colors, etc. would be my primary focus, right? 
When I first started my design career, that is what I thought too. With college level design classes, 95% of the focus is on how the website looks and how it makes the visitor feel. Once I started digging in and testing conversions, I realized that, in this industry, conversion elements will trump design every time. So, while design is important, it does take a back seat to conversion. 
                    </p>

                        You are gaining the benefits of my successes and failures since 2009. You don’t need to reinvent the wheel, just follow along and profit from my knowledge and experience.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        That said, let’s get into the look and feel of your site. What makes a website “Pop”? What gives a website that professional, modern feel that makes people say “Wow! I love this website”? What is that secret ingredient that says to a potential customer, “You can trust this company”?

                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        Branding

                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        If you want to build a long-term business that people remember, then you need consider your brand. An effective brand gives you an edge on the competition. But what exactly does “branding” mean?
                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        The Business Dictionary states: “Unique design, sign, symbol, words, or a combination of these, employed in creating an image that identifies a product and differentiates it from its competitors. Over time, this image becomes associated with a level of credibility, quality, and satisfaction in the consumer’s mind (see positioning). Thus brands help harried consumers in a crowded and complex marketplace, by standing for certain benefits and value. Legal name for a brand is trademark and, when it identifies or represents a firm, it is called a brand name and corporate identity.” 

                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        Simply put, your brand is the image you want to portray to the world. It is the promise you make to the customer. Who are you and what do you represent to the public?

                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        Are you a high-end provider? Or are you the affordable provider? You can’t be both and you can’t be all things to all people. Both models work, but it will depend on how you want to brand yourself. 

                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        The foundation of your brand is your logo, your company colors and the layout of your website, as well as the content on your website. Let’s break these down and address them individually. 

                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        Your Company Logo

                    </p>

                    
                    <p>
                        Will a good logo make or break a business? No, but if you want something people remember then you need one that differentiates you from the competition. With branding, you want to be top-of-mind when someone thinks about your service. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We all have brand loyalties, whether it is a favorite restaurant, vehicle or smart phone. If we see their logo on a sign, advertisement, van or left side of a company shirt, that is instant brand recognition. When it’s time to make a purchase, we tend to go to those brands that seem familiar and have built a sense of trust and recognition in our minds. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You want to have that same effect in your community. When people think of your industry or service, you want your logo to pop into their head. In a networking situation when someone asks for recommendations, you want as many advocates as possible out there referring you and your business.  My advice is to spend a little extra time and money on getting a great logo that sets you apart. 

                    </p>
                    We recommend that you find someone who specializes in logo design. Designing a website or a brochure is a completely different skill set than designing a logo. I consider myself pretty damn good at graphic design and web design, but when it comes to logo design, I turn to a dedicated professional. 

                    <p>
                        Good logo designers have something special that can’t be taught. Logo design is truly an art form. Each logo designer will have their own style and will be able to put the message you want to convey in a symbol and design.  

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is not always easy to find someone that captures your feelings about what you and your business represent. I recommend finding one that understands your business and what you are all about. Find one that understands your brand and your promise. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I believe a good logo will determine the overall look and feel of a website. When considering a logo, you have to consider colors. The color scheme of your logo will set the stage for color scheme of your entire website. Some colors attract and some repel. Let’s talk about how to choose colors that match your brand. 

                    </p>

                        Your Company Colors

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Color plays a major role in defining your brand. This visually obvious yet subtle aspect of a website has an important impact on the way your brand is perceived by the public. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Out of all our visual senses, color is the most influential, followed by shapes, symbols, and finally words. That is why I don’t put much emphasis on sales copy for this industry. You are providing a visual image for your service, so let’s focus on that.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Let’s look at what colors mean on a basic level. People associate how they feel about your brand according to their personal experience with your services. By selecting the right color combination, you are taking a step in the right direction to effectively promoting your brand. 

                    </p>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Red and Orange: Urgency, Emergency, Power, Vigor, Passion, Activity.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Black and Brown: Powerful, Mysterious, Elegance, Sophistication, High-end.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Yellow: Stress, Childish, Warning, Arrogance, Danger.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Pink and Purple: Romantic, Feminine, Soft, Sweet.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Based on these simple color signals, you can determine what feeling you want to convey with your brand and your logo. How do you want prospective clients to be drawn to your business? What is the unconscious feeling or emotion you hope the public will remember about your business when they see the logo, signage and website?

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now let’s see how the logo and color scheme fit into the website by first starting with two different types of layouts. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Layout Options

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After figuring out the color scheme of a website, we need to determine which style layout to use. Both the fixed width and fluid layouts are very functional. There may be many options out there to choose from, but this will give you insight to make a simple decision.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fixed Width Layout

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The fixed width layout is the classic website design style where a specific width is predetermined and then it typically is positioned in the center of the screen. On widescreen monitors, you will see a border or background where the website sits. On screens that are more square in shape, the background will not be visible and it will fill the screen. In this example you can see how the website sits in the middle with a faded background.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fluid Layout

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The fluid layout differs because there is no set width. It fills the screen from left to right regardless of the screen size. It will stretch and resize as the screen size changes. Many people prefer this option because it has more of a modern feel. These days most of the websites our company creates are in the fluid layout. 

                    </p>

                        Pictures and Images

                    </p>

                        As we discussed previously, in this industry a very visual website will convert better than a text-heavy informational website. We will get more into pictures and video in the Trust section, but let’s hit a few key points here to get your creative juices flowing. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If possible, use personalized photos as opposed to stock photography. When you get a few good pictures, they can be used over and over for all different types of marketing. I use the picture of myself in a nice polo shirt with a smile and a relaxed pose. I want people to know I’m a normal guy that is approachable. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Stock photography will work fine, but be absolutely sure you have permission to use them. Your site can be shut down if you are using photos without permission or giving attribution to the photographer or you can face fines. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You may be tempted to just right click on photos you find on Facebook or the web and copy them. I know you are now eager to get your website up and live, but it is better to get some quality custom photos taken by a professional photographer. These personal photos will really set you apart. You can find a local photographer on Cragislist.com for a reasonable price.

                    <p>
                        Try to match some of the colors in the photos with the colors in your logo and website color scheme. This will give the website a sense of flow and really help with the “Wow” factor.

                        Now that we have covered the major usability elements, it’s time to get into a few of the technical aspects of your website. In the next chapter, we will move on to domains, hosting and website management. You are on your way to your very own website that will be a Job-getting, Deal-closing, 24/7 Money- Making Machine.
